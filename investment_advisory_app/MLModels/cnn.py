'''
In this advanced CNN script:

The stock price data is loaded from a CSV file, assuming the file has columns named 'Date' and 'Close'.

The features and target variables are prepared. The features exclude the 'Date' column, and the target is the 'Close' column.

The features are scaled using MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to ensure all values are in the same range.

The data is reshaped to match the input shape of the CNN, which expects a 3-dimensional input with dimensions (num_samples, num_features, 1).

The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

A CNN model is defined with a 1D convolutional layer, max pooling layer, flatten layer, and dense layers.

The CNN model is compiled and trained using the training data.

Predictions are made for both the training and testing data.

The model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (coefficient of determination) metrics.
