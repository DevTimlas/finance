'''
In this advanced GPR script:

The stock price data is loaded from a CSV file, assuming the file has columns named 'Date' and 'Close'.

The features and target variables are prepared. The features exclude the 'Date' column, and the target is the 'Close' column.

The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

The GPR model is defined with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The length scale of the RBF kernel is set to 1.0 with bounds between 0.1 and 10.0.

The model is trained using the training data.

Predictions are made for both the training and testing data, along with the associated standard deviations of the predictions.

The model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (coefficient of determination) metrics.
